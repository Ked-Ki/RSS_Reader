RSS Reader 
author: Kevin Freese

This program is a rudimentary RSS feed reader, to be run in a terminal command
line.

Usage: ./rss.py to start

There are five commands:
'check [name]':     Typing this command without a [name] field results in the 
                    reader checking all feeds for new updates.
                    Typing a name will check all feeds for which [name] is a 
                    substring of the feed title.

'read {name}':      Typing this command requires a {name} field. This will result
                    in opening a page with the contents of the oldest item in the
                    feed with {name} as a substring of the feed title.

'subscribe {url}:   Typing this command will add a new feed to your subscription
                    list, and this feed will be included in every future check.

'help':             Displays a brief description of each command's usage.

'quit':             Exits the reader and returns to the shell.
