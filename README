__________________________________Description__________________________________
This program is a rudimentary RSS feed reader, to be run in a terminal command
line. Can read Atom and RSS feeds.

_____________________________________Usage_____________________________________
Run the script without any arguments (./rss.py) to start.

After the script is started, some initialization will occur, followed by a
check of all the feeds that you are subscribed to.

After that, a prompt will display. The following commands are accepted:

'check [name]':      Typing this command without a [name] field results in the 
                     reader checking all feeds for new updates.
                     Typing a name will check all feeds for which [name] is a 
                     substring of the feed title.

'read {name}':       Typing this command requires a {name} field. This will
                     result in opening a page with the contents of the oldest
                     item in the feed with {name} as a substring of the feed
                     title.
 
'mark {name}':       This command simply marks an item as read without opening
                     it. Same syntax as 'read'.

'markall {name}:     This command marks all items in the feed {name} as read.

'subscribe {url}':   Typing this command will add a new feed to your
                     subscription list, and this feed will be included in
                     every future check.

'unsubscribe {name}: This command removes a feed from your subscription list.
                     Requires typing the entire name of the feed, which is the
                     name displayed whenever a 'check' is run for that feed.

'help':              Displays a brief description of each command's usage.

'quit':              Exits the reader and returns to the shell.

____________________________________Options____________________________________
User-defined options can be found in the script itself (rss.py) under the 
heading "User-defined Options:" These options include:

data_folder:         This is the folder in which all the data for the reader is 
                     stored. Absolute paths will obviously go to that path on 
                     the drive. Relative paths or folder names without a path
                     will be created from the directory the script is run from.

subscription_file:   This is the filename for your subscription list.

history_file:        This is the filename for your read history.

_____________________________Bugs & Idiosyncracies_____________________________
3/19/13: Single quotes in feed titles are dropped, so feed titles such as 
         "That's it" will display as "Thats it" everywhere within the program.
